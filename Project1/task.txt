REST API -JSON
A RESTful API lets one app ask another app for data or tell it to do something â€” using simple web URLs and rules

GET /users - HTML document render
GET/api/users - List all users JSON data

GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2

Dynamic Path Parameters
Get /api/users/:id
:id -> Variable | Dynamic 
POST /api/users - Create new user

PATCH /api/user/id - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the User with ID 1

MOCKAROO.com generates fake data of users since we have no database connected right now

Now we cannot operate post,Patch,Delete on Browser so for this purpose we downloaded POSTMAN is is basically a utility tool jo Api testing and documentation mei help karta hai
